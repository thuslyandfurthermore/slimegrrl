            <p>a series of photos taken over the course of 2022 that all seem to share a sense of longing and wrongness. theyre in chronological order, except for the last, my favorite. after being tricked into coming out to people who would use it against me and my family i felt beyond lost. my hopes for a swift departure from hell were at an all time low, i got a job working overnight at a gas station, alone, compounding the swirl of emotions. i also purchased an lg stylo 6, which has a decent pair of cameras on the back, and a couple clip on phone lenses. no longer wanting to take pictures of myself i expressed my frustrations at the cage i was, am, in.</p>
            <p>beyond my particular circumstances santa cruz county is a place of promises burned at the first convenience, hardly a unique condition i know, still dusted with the literal ashes of fires from a mismanaged electrical grid that continues to leave towns in blackout for days at a time. homeless encampments that once dotted the outskirts of town were ripped up with the excuse of covid and pardoxically shoved into close quarters at a managed camp downtown, a genuine improvement in condition for the people there, if more claustrophobic and conducive to pandemic. but then that was ripped up too and people scattered again just as soon as praise stopped rolling in for the city council's empathy.</p></div>
